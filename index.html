        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Somin Jeon and I am currently enrolled in University of California, Riverside as a Pre-Business freshman. My goal is to finish all of my requirements and get accepted into a Business major. My expected concentration will be accounting and my future goal is to become a certified professional accountant and get hired at one of the Big 4 accounting firms. I have not experienced anything regarding my major yet but I am willing to participate in Hylander Financial Club, volunteer at Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and intern at RSM in the upcoming years. I once volunteered at Culver City City Hall as a poll worker. My duty was to welcome the voters, collect their names and hand them their voting papers. Accuracy, swiftness and positivity were the key to this job. I once was intimidated to participate in this job since I was required to provide a service to strangers who are passionate about who is ruling the entire city. I thought as I make even one mistake can influence their will and temper. However, everyone was appreciative with my service even though I was inexperienced at that time. Throughout this opportunity, I quickly adapted into the environment and developed myself into a more meticulous and embraced person. <br><br>

        
	After I volunteered at several places, I had decided to intern at a preschool. There were a total of thirteen students in one class setting. In each session, my duty was to watch over students while they were playing in the playground as well as to play along with them for an hour. As they go back to their classroom, my role was to wipe all the chairs and desks with clorox for sanitation and entertain them until their parents come pick them up. It was certainly a pleasant experience for me since I have never had an opportunity to be surrounded with a large sum of children at the same time. I also realized that my sense of hearing had developed over time as I thought students were talking nonsense in the beginning of my experience. Through this experience, I progressed my responsiveness and amicability. <br><br>

        After I graduated high school, I wanted to get hired at a part-time job. I dreamt to make money off of something that I enjoy doing. One of my favorite things in life is coffee. I always wanted to be one of the baristas who are good at interacting with their customers. I was thrilled to work as a barista at Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf during my summer vacation. That was the first real profession that I ever participated in. I was pressured not to make any mistakes even though it is inevitable. I tried myself to adapt into all of those required duties as soon as possible and provide the best service that I can possibly do so none of the customers would have felt that the service that they were getting is not worth the money. I quickly memorized all the recipes and did not forget to give them a smile as they ordered. I think the days that I worked at Coffee Bean are the most memorable times of my life and the most stressful. I realized that getting paid means I have to put so much effort and time into developing myself. In such a short period of time, my customer service skills and responsiveness quickly got improved.
